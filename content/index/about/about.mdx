Aloha! My name is Ken and I am a Coding Bootcamp Graduate with a certificate from the UC Berkeley 3 month Full Stack Developer Program. I come from a construction, engineering and IT background and am interested in learning and applying new strategies and techniques to build applications to help enrich the lives of many. 

I have aquired experience and skills using the following technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.js, React.js, to build full stack applications using the Mongo DB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN) stack. 
I am known to be highly motivatational and collaborative and have worked on multiple projects with various team members while utilizing Zoom, Slack, Github, and Gitlab during the 2020 Pandemic.

As a new developer I am excited to continue to learn, grow, innovate and collaborate as I embark on this incredible journey into the world of Tech.
