Aloha! My name is Ken and I am an adaptable Frontend Developer who has successfully completed a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp where I had the opportunity to design and develop applications while collaborating in an Agile team environment.  
My skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, mySQL, and Web APIs.
I also have professional experience collaborating and communicating in both small and large scale team settings in the Construction, Engineering and Information Technology industries.

I am known to be highly motivational and collaborative and have worked on multiple projects with various team members while utilizing Zoom, Slack, Discord, Github, and Gitlab during the 2020 Pandemic.

As a new developer I am excited to continue to learn, grow, innovate and collaborate as I embark on this incredible journey into the world of Tech.
